Wearable device for smart belt and shoes

My team made wearable devices and application which adjust one's posture wearing smart shoes and smart belt and posing wrong postures. 
They were produced sending alarm to the smart phone with vibration and pop-up if the users cross their legs or walk pigeon-toed or out-toed gait. 
We used genuino 101 board embedded gyro and acceleration sensors to implement our service. 
My roles in this project were surveying papers about right walking to build algorithms, 
composing UIs and giving basic functions in our application, 
and making hardware from figuring out the location of parts of foot to attaching the pressure sensors.
